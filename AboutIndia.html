            <b>India</b>
            <br>
            India is an incredible tapestry of cultures, languages, traditions, and 
            history. It&apos;s the world&apos;s largest democracy, with over <mark>1.4 billion people.</mark>
             Geographically, India is diverse, stretching from the towering Himalayas 
             in the north to the tropical beaches in the south, encompassing deserts, 
             plains, forests, and more. It&apos;s bounded by the Indian Ocean, the Arabian 
             Sea, and the Bay of Bengal, giving it a vast coastline.

            India is a large and distinctively shaped country on the world map, often described as resembling
             a diamond or a teardrop hanging from the base of Asia. It is located in South Asia and is bordered 
             by the Indian Ocean to the south, making its peninsular part quite prominent.
            To the west, it shares borders with Pakistan; to the north, it touches China, Nepal, 
            and Bhutan; and to the east, it neighbors Bangladesh and Myanmar. India's geographical
             features include the towering Himalayas to the north, the expansive Indo-Gangetic plain, 
             and the coastal areas flanking the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.
            Would you like me to describe India's geographical features in more detail, or
             perhaps something else about its position in the world?

        <p>
            Medieval Indian history, generally spanning from the 7th to the 18th centuries, 
            is a rich period marked by the rise and fall of various kingdoms, the emergence 
            of new religious and cultural movements, and the arrival of foreign powers. 
            It can be broadly divided into the early and late medieval periods, each with 
            distinct characteristics. The early medieval period saw the fragmentation of 
            large empires into smaller regional kingdoms, while the late medieval period 
            saw the consolidation of power under the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. 
        </p>
        <li><b>Rise of Regional Kingdoms:</b> Following the decline of the Gupta Empire,
             India fragmented into numerous regional kingdoms, including the Pratiharas,
             Palas, and Rashtrakutas in the north, and the Cholas, Pallavas, and Rashtrakutas
            in the south.</li>

            </tr>
           </table>

<br>
           <li><b>Tripartite Struggle:</b> A major feature of this period was the 
            "tripartite struggle" between the Pratiharas, Palas, and Rashtrakutas 
            for control of Kannauj (modern-day Uttar Pradesh).</li>
